# Sochana
To identify dyslexia, dyscalculia and autism in school going children

A multi-faceted approach, Project Sochana seeks to raise awareness about neurodevelopmental disorders and provide tools and resources for early screening and intervention. We will work closely with schools, parents, and healthcare professionals to implement evidence-based screening protocols and assessments that can help identify potential signs of autism, dyslexia, and dyscalculia in children.

The system architecture resembles the below picture
